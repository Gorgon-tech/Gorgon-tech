- 👋 Hi, I’m @Gorgon-tech, you could just refer to me as Damo
- 👀 I’m interested in Coding, Chemistry, Physics, and Cool Math Stuff.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning python, I'm hardstuck lol, C script, and C++. Although, detracted from that I am also learning theoretical organic chemistry and quantum field theory.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any project you think I could help on, I'm fairly fluent in nodeJS, HTML, kind of python, and R. You can also hit me up if you want to chat about coding or any other topic, I'd love to have a conversation.
- 📫 You can contact me by gmail at Tetracolohine7@gmail.com or on discord at MentionableCow #0182.
